# Sentiment Analysis

This notebook experiments with different models for sentiment analysis for the final project in Text Analytics. The classifier is always Naive Bayes, but the preprocessing and inputs/features into the model vary. To run the model and view the results/writeup, simply open `Final Project.ipynb` and run cells in order.
